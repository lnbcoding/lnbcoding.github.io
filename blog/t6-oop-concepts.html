            <p>NFL Scope it up | Oct 26, 2014</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>Ruby supports the following variables: <code><br /><br />$global_var  = accessed and available throughout the entire program. Var name is not available to use again<br /> <br />@@class_var  = available for all instances/objects of that class<br /><br /> @instance_var = available only for the specific instance of that class<br /><br /> local_var = available only in the code block where the variable was defined in<br /><br /> CONSTANT = a constant value, it is good practice to not change this value<br /> </code></p>
            <p>I am going to give out an example of each variable's scope using real-life examples. Let's use the NFL as an example since it is so awesome to watch</p>
            <p>The NFL is America's favorite sports to watch. In this case, we set it a global var of <code>$nfl = "America's number one sport"</code> No matter what happens throughout our program, the global variable of <code>$nfl</code> will have that string assigned to it and the variable of <code>$nfl</code> is not available to use as a variable name anymore.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a class Players with a class variable of <code>@@nfl_players = []</code> We want to get a count of all the players in the NFL. We can use that class variable and store all the player objects we created into that <code>@@nfl_players</code> variable. This class variable is available to all player objects whether they play on offense, defense, special teams or a superstar veteran or just a humble rookie bench player.</p>
            <p>For an instance variable that is only available for that created object, we can think of a player's <code>@jersey_number</code> This means that all objects of that Player class has access to a variable named jersey_number where the player can have a jersey number assigned to them.</p>
            <p>I often get confused between a <code>@@class_var</code> and an <code>@instance_var</code>. I just try and think, will this variable be shared by all objects of that class? Or will that variable be only for that specific instance of the class?</p>
            <p>A good local var example would be a variable name that is general and we can re-use in later parts of the program. One of the metrics NFL scouts are obsessed over are a player's <code>time</code>. Whether that be the 40 yd dash, the 10yd shuttle run, or how long a player has been on the injured list. With a local_var of <code>time</code> we can use the same name of <code>time</code> for the different parts to calculate the 40 yd dash, the 10 yd shuttle run, and so on</p>
            <p>In this case a CONSTANT would be easy for the NFL program, we can use <code>FIELD_GOAL = 3</code> to set the value of the FIELD_GOAL constant as 3. No matter what happens in the NFL, a field goal is always worth 3 points. Notice how all the letters are upper-case, each scope variable type should match the naming conventions I listed above in order for Ruby to pick them up.</p>
