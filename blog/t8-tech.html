            <p>Recursion ... | Nov 9, 2014</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>When I ask the Developers I use to work with about recursion, the always come back with this joke: "In order to understand recursion, you need to understand recursion." Well I don't understand recursion but this blog will be about researching on this fascinating Computer Science topic. The most basic definition of recursion is a function that calls itself.</p>
            <p>Usually in a program, a function is declared and defined at the beginning of a file. Please see the simple function below.</p>
            <code>
                def print_name(name)</br>
                    print "Hello, #{name} how's it going? Have a good day, buddy."</br>
                end</br>
            </code>
            <p>In order to get the function to work, we need to call it using the function name of:</p>
            <code>print_name("Leonard)</code>
            <p>Recursion breaks down a large, complex problem into smaller versions of itself. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/717725/understanding-recursion"> post on stackoverflow</a> gave a pretty good explanation on recursion with the following example:</p>
            <p>How do you empty a vase containing three flowers?
            Answer: if the vase is not empty, you take out one flower and then you empty a vase containing two flowers.</br></br>
            How do you empty a vase containing two flowers?
            Answer: if the vase is not empty, you take out one flower and then you empty a vase containing one flower.</br></br>
            How do you empty a vase containing one flower?
            Answer: if the vase is not empty, you take out one flower and then you empty a vase containing no flowers.</br></br>
            How do you empty a vase containing no flowers?
            Answer: if the vase is not empty, you take out one flower but the vase is empty so you're done.</br></br>
            That's repetitive. Let's generalize it:</br></br>
            How do you empty a vase containing N flowers?
            Answer: if the vase is not empty, you take out one flower and then you empty a vase containing N-1 flowers.</p>
            <p>This is just a general simple explanation. In fact, with that example we could have used a for loop. But with more complex problems where you can break it down to smaller, recursive steps, a recursive function would be better. When at Devbootcamp, I hope to learn more and understand recursion so that I can now make the joke to others who ask me about it!</p>
