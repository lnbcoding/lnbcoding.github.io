            <p>Internet Security, it's a 2-step process | Oct 12, 2014</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>I always remember this quote from the Spiderman move "With great power comes great responsibility." In a way I feel this is akin to the Internet and the big Tech companies. All the information, data and privacy are stored in the so-called Internet Cloud. How are we sure that our information is safe from hackers or private from the Government?</p>
            <p>There is constant news about how the Government and the NSA are working together with the big Tech companies. And how the NSA has their own "keys" to the castle and get can decrypt or unlock any of the security guarding our data. This means personal info such as name, social security, credit card info, and private emails/messages can be read by the Government. It's not just the Government that can access our data; sophisticated hackers are looking for ways to do identity theft and stealing credit card info. Just a few weeks ago, a high profile case emerged where some personal photos from celebrities were hacked into and exposed to the Internet. Some of the hackers are indeed sophisticated but I would say the majority of the theft are from simple methods such as answering simple questions for a password reset. To login to online accounts, there is always a password reset link. Hackers can use those links and with basic Facebook searches, they can find answers to these common password reset questions such as Elementary school name and maiden name and so on.</p>
            <p>How can we make sure our personal data stored in the Internet is safe and confidential? If we can somehow have an RSA type encryption key method for the data that changes the algos and keys after an x amount of time, then maybe that would help. I know that online banks will give clients an RSA key that generates a new code after each button is clicked. That new code is then used in conjunction with the user's login and password credentials. One of the first steps in stopping the majority of the hacking is to have a 2-step authentication system similar to the RSA key I mentioned above. Maybe require that each online financial access also will require sending and entering a private code that is sent to your mobile phone. Don't get me wrong, hackers can hack into your phone as well but at least there is another barrier that hackers have to break through.</p>
