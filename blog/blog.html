        <p>DBC Expectations | Sep 20, 2014</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main_blog">
        <p>DBC experience sounds like an intense, life changing event. I feel that DBC is introducing a new study technique of immersive education. It is more than the hard, tech skills though. Of course you will learn about programming and the different languages. But there is more soft skills as well. How to interact and work with others. How to properly give feedback and being 'nice and honest' when doing so. Also how to take feedback and properly incorporate them into your life. There is also yoga classes and focus mediations to focus on just the topic at hand. This is one of the things I am hoping to improve on. I try to do and understand everything at once. I also need for things to be 'perfect and planned' before I move on. I am hoping DBC can help me understand and apply the concept of focusing on one thing at a time and incorporating habits by doing small changes in your life.

        I am also looking forward to control my emotions and properly 'learn' in a different environment than a traditional school. I am excited about setting foot in the DBC experience. Throughout school I believe I learn best by watching videos, doing repetitions, and independently thinking about it. With DBC, I am hoping to learn in a different way by interacting with others, doing pair programming and taking my education in my own hands instead of just reading and hearing lectures.

        I know that it is intense though and there will be long hours. I am nervous about not being able to last. I have a dry eye condition and can get eye strain fairly easily. I am also nervous about not understanding everything and then having to move on to a different learning topic. I think I need to better incorporate time boxing and not drift away on topics that I do not enjoy and do not understand right away. Of course I am worried about not being able to find a job after graduation.</p>

        <p>Benefits of Version Control System |  Sep 20, 2014</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main_blog">
        <p>A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to easily view all change history info, such as when, who, what and why something was changed. This allows a developer to easily view past changes. Each past change is a saved checkpoint where you can revert back to that past state, instead of starting at the beginning again. I like to think of it as respawning in a video game. The more commit saves you do, the better as it gives you more options to respawn at a certain point.

        You can use Git to view all past changes by typing in the simple command of "git log". This will show the order of changes from most recent to least recent. Each commit saved checkpoint has a commit message so that others can see what changes you did. Git encourages teamwork by having each member use their own copy of the master repository. Each member may pull code from other repos to do a code review. After a code check, you can then do a code push to the master repo.

        GitHub is an online hub that stores remote repositories (code and the version history for a certain project). Storing code on GitHub is good because it is the most popular repo storage and you can colloborate with other members to view and share your code. If you are stuck on a certain problem, you can ask other devs to take a look and help you out. It is a two way street. You can ask others to review your code for ideas and you can also help others by checking out their code and doing any enhancements.

        I would think of git has having your own cookbook in front of you. Whatever changes you do in the cookbook is in your hands. But what if you could create a copy of that cookbook and distribute it to known and friend family cooks so they can add/edit their own recipes? Think of Git as this. Whatever updates in your cookbook is automatically entered into a version control system known as Git. I would then think of GitHub as the worldwide collection of all cookbooks from everyone. So you could checkout, or borrow a cookbook from a known chef, say Thomas Keller and then edit one of his steak recipes with your own enhancements! We can think of GitHub as an online collection of everyone's recipe book.</p>
