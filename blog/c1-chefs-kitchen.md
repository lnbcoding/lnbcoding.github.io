#### DBC Expectations
#### Sep 20, 2014

DBC experience sounds like an intense, life changing event. I feel that DBC is introducing a new study technique of immersive education. It is more than the hard, tech skills though. Of course you will learn about programming and the different languages. But there is more soft skills as well. How to interact and work with others. How to properly give feedback and being 'nice and honest' when doing so. Also how to take feedback and properly incorporate them into your life. There is also yoga classes and focus mediations to focus on just the topic at hand. This is one of the things I am hoping to improve on. I try to do and understand everything at once. I also need for things to be 'perfect and planned' before I move on. I am hoping DBC can help me understand and apply the concept of focusing on one thing at a time and incorporating habits by doing small changes in your life.

I am also looking forward to control my emotions and properly 'learn' in a different environment than a traditional school. I am excited about setting foot in the DBC experience. Throughout school I believe I learn best by watching videos, doing repetitions, and independently thinking about it. With DBC, I am hoping to learn in a different way by interacting with others, doing pair programming and taking my education in my own hands instead of just reading and hearing lectures.

I know that it is intense though and there will be long hours. I am nervous about not being able to last. I have a dry eye condition and can get eye strain fairly easily. I am also nervous about not understanding everything and then having to move on to a different learning topic. I think I need to better incorporate time boxing and not drift away on topics that I do not enjoy and do not understand right away. Of course I am worried about not being able to find a job after graduation.
