  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),

# Benefits of a Version Control System
#### Why use Git
#### Sep 20, 2014

A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to easily view all change history info, such as when, who, what and why something was changed. This allows a developer to easily view past changes. Each past change is a saved checkpoint where you can revert back to that past state, instead of starting at the beginning again. I like to think of it as respawning in a video game. The more commit saves you do, the better as it gives you more options to respawn at a certain point.

You can use Git to view all past changes by typing in the simple command of "git log". This will show the order of changes from most recent to least recent. Each commit saved checkpoint has a commit message so that others can see what changes you did. Git encourages teamwork by having each member use their own copy of the master repository. Each member may pull code from other repos to do a code review. After a code check, you can then do a code push to the master repo.

GitHub is an online hub that stores remote repositories (code and the version history for a certain project). Storing code on GitHub is good because it is the most popular repo storage and you can colloborate with other members to view and share your code. If you are stuck on a certain problem, you can ask other devs to take a look and help you out. It is a two way street. You can ask others to review your code for ideas and you can also help others by checking out their code and doing any enhancements.

I would think of git has having your own cookbook in front of you. Whatever changes you do in the cookbook is in your hands. But what if you could create a copy of that cookbook and distribute it to known and friend family cooks so they can add/edit their own recipes? Think of Git as this. Whatever updates in your cookbook is automatically entered into a version control system known as Git. I would then think of GitHub as the worldwide collection of all cookbooks from everyone. So you could checkout, or borrow a cookbook from a known chef, say Thomas Keller and then edit one of his steak recipes with your own enhancements! We can think of GitHub as an online collection of everyone's recipe book.
