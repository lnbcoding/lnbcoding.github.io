        <p>But your Asian | Oct 26, 2014</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main_blog">
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is eating different cuisines. I usually go to lunch with my co-workers every Friday and we try different foods. Whenever we eat at an Asian cuisine such as Dim Sum, I always ask the waiters for a fork to use instead of a chopstick. Every time that happens, someone will remark that you are Asian and should be using a chopstick instead. I always reply that it is easier and cleaner for me to use fork! Another example of this 'food stereotype' is that I do not like Siracha or anything spicy. Co-workers will immediately reply that "but you're Vietnamese, you guys love Siracha." I reply kindly not this Vietnamese guy and I don't like the taste of it.</p>
        <p>Now these stereotypes are harmless to me and my co-workers are just needling me. I was not badly discriminated or denied something because of my ethnicity. However it is still a form of stereotype that people need to be aware of. We need to stop making snap judgements or collectively bucketing someone based on their ethnicity or appearance. If I see someone facing a more serious stereotype threat, I hope that I have the guts to say something to end the stereotype. But there is a "herd mentality" that I am guilty of it. It is hard to be the first person to step in and say something. Usually everyone goes in with their merry ways and that poor person is left standing there by themselves. Maybe the next time I witness something, I will take in that person and in private, just tell them that I don't believe in that stereotype and ask them if they want to talk about it privately. I know that I don't like being the center of attention/focus so if I could just grab that person in private that could be a good small step for me.</p>
        <p>In these tenser situations I think a good joke to break the tension will also help calm people down. Don't be disrespectful of someone but if you could crack a good, politically correct joke then that would help clear up the tension. Another way to help in these situations is to 'side' with the person being stereotyped. Just say something how you feel the same way as well so the person doesn't feel alone and being ganged up on. But in conclusion, it is good manta to treat others as you would like to be treated. Do not treat others as if they are below you in any level</p>
