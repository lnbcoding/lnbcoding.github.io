            <p>Order I say, order. I sound like a judge or a work captain on the Titanic, but apparently my learning style is both of concrete and abstract sequential. I like to think in step by step orders and flows. When going over a problem and summarizing a topic, I like to use bullet points instead of writing in paragraph formats. I don't subscribed to the Joker's concept of "Embracing Chaos". I like to think structurally and plan, usually in my mind, about what I think should happen. I am hoping to improve my planning process by writing it down instead of having it stored in my mind.</p>
            <p>The majority of DBC's instructions in Phase 0 are mostly written in step by step format so that has been helpful for learning the topics. However, most of the tutorials are in written form where I have to read and understand the concepts. I checked out some Ruby books in the library and was reading them but it was difficult for me to concentrate and understand, so I went back online and googled online tutorials. I know that I learn best by seeing a demo or watching a video of someone explaining the topic. I am supplementing reading the tutorials from DBC by watching videos on youtube and subscribing to a teamtreehouse.com account to watch examples on a certain topic. Watching the videos on the Command Line and the CSS positioning definitely helped me more than reading text.</p>
            <p>My biggest struggle is absorbing all the information and remembering when and what concepts to use. We are already moving so fast and as you learn a new concept, the week is over and it is on to the next topic. I can only imagine what the onsite intensive part will be like. I already am getting tired from working 40 hours a week and studying at night for DBC. Just thinking about how 1 day of DBC onsite is equivalent to 1 week of Phase 0 prep is nerve wracking! How can we learn all that and still remember what we learned like a month ago during Phase 0. But I have to trust the process and understand the DBC has a proven track record of helping someone become a junior software dev. It is a long process and I am just in the beginning steps.</p>
            <p>Even though I am a Abstract Sequential learner and like working alone, I feel that the peer pairing has been very helpful in expanding my knowledge. It is great to bounce ideas of others and learning others' thoughts. An example of this was using loops to solve a challenge. I don't have a great understanding of loops so it was great to go over some of the looping concepts while pairing.</p>
            <p>One of the things that I have improved on since week 1 is not waiting for the situation to be 'perfect' while I am learning and moving on to the next step. Because time is so limited and there is so much to absorb I cannot expect to learn and understand everything right away. Don't get me wrong, I still get frustrated but I then timebox and move on to the next challenge. I feel that I have improved my Growth mindset as well. In the past when I see Devs use the command line at work, I would get lost and think that I could never understand that. However I took time to read and more better for me, watch tutorials on what the Command Line is and how to use the basic concepts. That helps fuel my confidence in topics that I don't understand right away, such as CSS positioning and Ruby loops</p>
