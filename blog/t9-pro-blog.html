            <p>HTML/CSS Planning is a must! | Nov 15, 2014</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>So I just spent like 3.5 hours cleaning up my site and blog posting. There are some UI changes such as moving the social media icons to the bottom and organizing the blog index page into different types of postings. It sounded like an easy process but unfortunately my original HTML and CSS was a mess. The different class names did not make sense and the CSS ordering was all over the place. It took me a lot of time to separate the CSS file into different sections so that it will be easier to change in the future. I did not even have time to install a framework or add in some javascript since all my time was on fixing the original mess. I learned how important the concepts of include or required files are. When I wanted to change the header and footer links, I had to open each of the 20 or so pages and copy/paste the new links. It was a pain to do this.</p>
            <p>Now I know why it is so important to have a separation of concerns so that if you do a change to a site, you only need to do the change in one file instead of in all the pages. My original planning of the site and blog was very bad as well. I did not use enough divs and did not understand what I needed to do. CSS is still a challenge for me. I initially wanted to put my nav links on the right side of my header but I still could not get that to work. My spacing for the Blog Index page is also off and it was tedious trying to figure out what was wrong and how to minimize the spacing. I was planning to time box this for 2 hours but at the 2 hour mark, my page was broken and was still a mess. I then took an hour break and that really helped me out. Immediately after the break I got the social media icons on the footer to display nicely. My blog index and the other pages were using different stylesheets and it was very annoying trying to figure out which selector affected what. Again, that was a problem with my original site because it was organized so badly. It was also frustrating clicking on the Blog page and the header would shift up, while the other pages (Resume, About Me, Contact) would have a "frozen" header bar that was  displayed at the same spot. It felt good when I played around with different browser sizes and the header and footer were not a mess anymore. The site is not mobile responsive but at least this time the CSS is not broken in smaller viewports!</p>
