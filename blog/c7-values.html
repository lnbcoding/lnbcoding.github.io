            <p>It may be cliche but accomplishments is the value that has made me the most proudest and satisfied in my life. Whether it was a longer term thing like studying and working hard to graduate from college. Or spending a couple of hours to break down a coding challenge and finally having everything "click" in your mind are great feelings. Seeing the Bingo Board displayed with the correct "x's" marked was a great accomplishment for me. Accomplishments at work makes me feel good such as when the Director of Engineering says that I will be greatly missed when I leave for DBC. It means that I connected well with my co-workers and garnered great domain knowledge at my job. Like most everyone, I want to feel appreciated and respected for what I have done. When you accomplish something that was tough for you in the beginning, it sort of validates and stamps all the hard work that was put into it. </p>
            <p>In general I try to live up to the following values on a scale of 1 through 5, with the higher numbers I agree to:<br/>
                Accountability: 5 <br />
                Accomplishment: 4 <br />
                Challenge: 2 <br />
                Confidence: 4 <br />
                Self-respect: 5 <br />
                Wealth: 3 <br />
            I know that one of my flaws is that I do not push myself as hard as I can and love having a set routine. A good example of this is weightlifting with my cousin. I will suggest doing the same weights and reps over again, while he will constantly suggest moving up.</p>
            <p>The last topic someone asked for my advice happened at work. I had to explain to her about how the different features at our company function and how they are integrated together. A co-worker asked me about what an Internal Report did and I gave a detailed explanation for it. Again it feels good because it means that I know and understand the product well enough to explain to a fellow co-worker. I know that DBC will be an intense environment and having the courage and belief to quit you job and change skill sets is an achievement in its own right. I think it takes some guts and decisiveness to pivot to a Developer Role and it makes me feel good that I did it. I already broke my mold of routines and being happy with the status quo. When there is something tough in DBC I need to remember that what we are doing is a pretty darn good achievement in itself. There is a fine line tough, it doesn't mean that I shouldn't study harder to absorb all the tech info. It means being self-aware that choosing to attend DBC is changing your life for the better by increasing your knowledge and varying your learning perspective.</p>
