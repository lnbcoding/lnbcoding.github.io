        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>Sibling conflicts are always fun. I have an older brother and a younger sister. When we get into arguments it is funny to see each other's personality shine. An example of this is with my older brother. I remember it was over our cell phone contract. I wanted to move over to T-mobile to save some money. However I ended our then current plan with AT&T prematurely before our new contract with T-mobile was setup. So we were out of cell phone service for one week. I know this is first world problems but my brother was pissed about how I could be so careless.</p>
            <p>His compass of shame is to attack other. He would say how stupid and careless I was. He wanted me to call either service right away so that he could have service asap! Well, in a conflict I choose the withdrawal method. I am usually quiet and chill during this situations. This case was also similar. I was quiet and didn't respond to him but in the background I did try to solve the issue but calling T-mobile to expedite the sim cards and if we could visit a local store to activate in 3 days instead of the original week.</p>
            <p>My actions made the conflict better in my opinion. To me it is not good when two people are yelling and trading insults and past, failed examples during a conflict. I'm not saying I'm not guilty of this but in these conflicts I try and keep an even keel. I think this helped calm the tense situation and everything was better. I remember reading a quote somewhere that a husband and wife should never yell or argue with each other unless the house was on fire! I try to keep with this quote whenever a conflict arises. For future conflicts, I think it is better if I explain what and how I am trying to solve the problem during the conflict instead of waiting till it's over. One of my personality traits is to do/fix things quietly. In the future I hope to diffuse the situation faster by saying how I will fix the problem and what the lessons I learned were.</p>
