            <p>Pairing / Feedback Thoughts | Oct 19, 2014</p>

        <div class="main_blog">
            <p>Working with others is such an important part of any career. Being a developer and working in teams is no exception. One of the great things that Devbootcamp emphasis early on is the power of Pair Programming. This is where two people work together to analyze, outline and code a solution to a challenge. Pairing is great because you can learn so much tech and soft skills from your partner, as well as yourself.</p>
            <p>I had great DBC partners who think differently than me and use methods that I would have never thought of using. Because we are working together I can see firsthand what their thought process is and why they choose the method the did. You get to work with different personality types so it helps your teamwork skills and how to adjust to different people. Of course there are frustrations. Some pairings I had in the past were tough where we were both lost in what to do. It took us over 2.5 hours to figure out what needed to be done. But after a short break, we huddled up and got the code to pass the Rspec testing and it felt awesome. Conversely I had pairings where I learned so much tech knowledge from my pair. How they used a method and what code did what by showing them to me in IRB made it really easy to understand.</p>
            <p>After each pairing, we submit feedback to each other. Reading people's feedback of me is a good learning experience to see what I need to improve on. I can already tell that I need to speak up on my thoughts more. More often than not, I just write the code down without explaining the thought process. I think this is part my personality, part not understanding the syntax right away, and part not preparing beforehand. I need to spend some time to read up and prep for the challenge beforehand. That should get me to be more comfortable and more vocal. </p>
            <p>Feedback also helps me brush up on things that I am not so comfortable with such has Hash methods and refactoring existing code. It's nice to hear that people enjoy and feel respected when pairing with me. I hope that means I am a good team player and can work well with others. Sometimes writing feedback is tough. I had a pair where our personalities kind of clash and the pair was taking too much time and I was frustrated. I informed my pair about this in hopefully a KIND way so that they can improve on it in the future. Most difficult thing is to write something that is Actionable, Specific and Kind as well. You want to tell them things to improve on but that could be personality specific that are harder to change. I now how stubborn I can be as well!</p>
