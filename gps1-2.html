        <h2>What is pair Programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is when you have 2 people working together on the same file and solve the problem together. During a pair programming session, one will take on the Navigator role and the other will take on the Driver role. The idea behind pair programming is to create opportunity for people to learn from each other or allow people with less experience to be guided by a more experienced programmer. Solving problems in this way not only provide a great environment for exchanging ideas but also reduce errors as one person is more focused on the algorithm while the other can focus on accuracy of the codes.</p>

        <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
        <p>DBC is such an intense and short program that effective pair programming can accelerate learning for everyone. People with more experience on the subject can provide guidance which can further enhances their understanding on the subject. And the people who are less experienced can benefit from approaches and techniques from their guide. In situation where both people in a pair have the same level of understanding, they serve as an additional pair of eyes that reduces errors or identify them sooner. Pair programming is great way to learn from each other and help build relationships at the same time.</p>

        <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
        <p>Navigator in general is the person who gives direction and communicates the algorithm to be used to solve a problem. They mainly focus on designing the potential solution and guiding the Driver to execute the solution. The Driver usually will type out codes as instructed by the Navigator and pay attention to the accuracy and the feasibility of the instruction given by the Navigator. These are general definition for the roles of Navigator and  Driver but what each role should do depends on the preference of the pair and each individual's experience on the subject matter.
